Hex Flower Generator is python implementation of Hex Flower tool
created by Goblin's Henchmen. When finished, this program will include
an standalone installer and allow the user to create their own hex
flower "files" using instructions in the documentation. It will render
the hex flower and allow the user to specify starting position and the
walk through the flower.

Much thanks to both creators for creating this wonderful set that appears
in this application.

The concept and many of the random walk designs belong to Goblin's
Henchmen (https://goblinshenchman.wordpress.com/).

Jupyter Notebook and other Anaconda packages used in development are part of
that community. ipycanvas and ipyevents are projects in the Conda Forge which
also contributed to this project.
